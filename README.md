# Iterative-computation-of-Nash-equilibrium
erative computation of Nash equilibrium. For matrix games, there are iterative methods to compute optimal strategies and the value of a game. This was shown by Julia Robinson: An Iterative Method of Solving a Game (Annals of Mathematics, 1951). Implement such an iterative method and study its how quickly it convergences.
